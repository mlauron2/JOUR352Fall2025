<p>The RFK Stadium Deal was recently approved by the Washington, D.C. council on Sept. 18. This allows the Washington Commanders to build a new, $3.7 billion stadium on the former RFK stadium site. 
</p>

<p>The construction of the new 65,000-seat stadium is set to begin in spring 2027 with expected full completion by 2030. The project will be funded primarily by the team, who will be paying for $2.7 billion of the project. The other $1.1 billion will be funded publicly through taxation.</p>

<p>This has raised concerns among D.C. taxpayers that wonder how this shift in public spending will affect them. Jenny Reed, the mayor’s budget director, laid out the plans for the budget. The city dropped plans for a $395 million dollar jail project. They were also to free up $800 million through a combination of savings and refinancing, according to Reed.

<p>“No school, library or recreation center project was delayed or cut in funding,” Reed told reporters.</p>
</div>

<p>$500 million of the budget will be used for infrastructure, $350 million for parking garages, and $202 million for transit study and utilities.

<p>This has re-sparked a debate that has been going on for years:</p> 



<div class="pullquote">
<p>Is it really worth it to use tax dollars to fund pro-sports stadiums?</p>
</div>

<p>According to a Washington Post-Schar School poll taken in May, a 55% majority of D.C. residents favor using district funds. This is an 8 percentage-point increase from their 2024 poll, and a 30 percentage-point increase from 2022.</p>

<p>This comes after a Commanders team resurgence during the 2024 season. The team had their best year in over a decade, finishing with a 12-5 record and a NFC championship appearance.</p>

<p>“When the Commanders are good, the city feels more alive” says UMD student and D.C. resident Jayden Duran. “I’m excited to have them closer to home.”</p> 

<p>D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser also said moving the Commanders back to D.C. will be very beneficial to the economy. The deal entails a plan that will create 6,000 units of housing around the stadium.</p>

<p>“It is with great pride that I can say we are officially bringing our Commanders home and turning 180 acres of land on the banks of the Anacostia, on the monumental axis, into jobs and opportunity for DC residents,” Bower said in a statement after the vote passed. “This will be the largest economic development project in D.C. history.”</p>

<br><br>

<br>
<p>Sports stadiums often directly offer jobs through concessions, parking and more. Many supporters of the deal also argue that local businesses benefit from the stadium through foot traffic and merchandise.
</p>

<p>Others argue that the stadium shouldn’t use public funding at all. “From the start, I have opposed the use of taxpayer dollars to support a stadium for a private organization, owned by billionaires, that will make them billions of dollars,” Councilmember Brianne K. Nadeau said in a statement back in August. “The city has negotiated a deal that will pay well for the team, but not for the District or its residents.”
</p>

<p>She said the Commanders can thrive in D.C. regardless of whether they get taxpayer money or not, citing limited return on investment for the city. Nadaeu along with other opponents of the deal believed the space left from the RFK stadium should be used for more housing.</p>

<p>Despite these concerns, Nadaeu was one of just two councilmembers who turned down the bill. The deal was passed with a 11-2 vote. The Commanders are planning to return to D.C. by the 2030 season.</p>
